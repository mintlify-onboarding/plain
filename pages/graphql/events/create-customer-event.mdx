# Create a customer event

<Callout type="error" emoji="ðŸš§">
  This API is being actively developed and is not yet ready for production usage. If you are interested in using events please get in touch with us at [help@plain.com](mailto:help@plain.com)

</Callout>

To create an event you need a customer ID.

You can get this by [upserting a customer](/graphql/customers/upsert) in Plain, from data in webhooks or other API calls you made. If you want to test this, press **âŒ˜ + K** on any thread and then "Copy customer ID" to get an ID you can experiment with.

In this example we'll be creating the following event:

<ImageContainer withBorder={true}>
  ![Example event](/images/events/events-example.png)
</ImageContainer>

<Tabs items={['Typescript SDK', 'GraphQL']}>
  <Tab>
    For this you'll need an API key with the following permissions:
    - `customerEvent:create`
    - `customerEvent:read`
    - `customer:read`

    <CreateCustomerEventTypescript />
    Which would console.log:
    <CreateCustomerEventTypescriptResponse />

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    For this you'll need an API key with the following permissions:
    - `customerEvent:create`
    - `customerEvent:read`

    <CreateCustomerEventGraphQL />

  </Tab>
</Tabs>
