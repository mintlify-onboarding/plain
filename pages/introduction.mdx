# Getting started with Plain

Plain is the customer support tool for B2B products.

We want to bring engineering and support teams together by creating a modern opinionated platform that's fantastic to build with and use.

Find out more about what Plain can do on [plain.com](https://plain.com)

### Where should I start?

First, you should sign-up to Plain by visiting https://app.plain.com/ and following the instructions there.

The only requirement for you to use plain is that you [set up email](/email-setup).

### What can I do with your API?

Plain is built API-first which means that app.plain.com is built using the same API we make available to you. This fundamentally means that you can automate all kinds of support interactions and deeply embed support into your product if you will.

For example:

- You can [build a contact form](http://localhost:4100/docs/getting-started/contact-forms-setup) which when submited creates a thread in Plain which is pre-categorised and prioritised based on the contact form content.
- You can [organise your customers in different groups](/graphql/customers/customer-groups) (e.g. "Enterprise plan", "Starter plan", "Design partners" etc.) so that you can segment your support queue by your different groups.
- You can [add Customer Cards](/docs/getting-started/customer-cards-setup) to Plain to show important data/context about your customers directly in Plain.
- You can [log important events](/getting-started/events-setup) to a customer's timeline so you have the full context of their activity when helping them.
- You can use our [webhooks](/webhooks) to build autoresponders, auto-assign threads and much more.
