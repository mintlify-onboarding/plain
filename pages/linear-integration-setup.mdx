# Linear integration

To make it easy to keep track of feature requests and bugs reported in Plain you can connect your Linear workspace with Plain.

This then lets you easily link a Linear issue to a thread.

<ImageContainer withBorder={true}>
  ![Screenshot of the floating contact form](/images/linear-integration/linear-integration.png)
</ImageContainer>

To do this head to **Settings** â†’ **Linear integration** and connect your workspace.

Once this set-up is done you can from any thread add a Linear issue from the right hand side or by pressing the shortcut `i`.

Once a linear issue is linked the thread will be moved back to Todo when the Linear issue is completed or cancelled.

This means you can then close the loop and let customers know of the bug or feature request they reported to you.
