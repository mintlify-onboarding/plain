However, using our API to manage customers proactively can be helpful when you are optimizing your support workflow.

For example:

- You can [**put customers into groups**](/graphql/customers-setup/customer-groups/) to better organize your support queue. For example, you could group customers by pricing tier (e.g. Free Tier, Teams, Enterprise)
- You can [**create customers**](/graphql/customers-setup/upsert/) in Plain when they sign-up on your own site so that you can reach out to them proactively without waiting for them to get in touch.
- You can [**save your own customer's ID**](/graphql/customers-setup/upsert) for use with [**Customer Cards**](/customer-cards/).
