# Labels

Labels are a light weight and powerful way to categorise your threads in Plain.

We recommend categorising threads into groups which let you meaningfully prioritise how to help customers.

For example:

- "Bug report"
- "Sales"
- "Feedback" or "Feature requests"
- "API question"
- etc.

In combination with thread priorities this can unlock some powerful workflows and let you quickly triage your threads to work on what matters most, first.

To configure your labels press ⌘ + K and then search for "Manage labels" or go to **Settings** → **Labels**. Here you can define the icon and name of your labels.

A thread can have multiple labels applied and they are displayed throughout the Plain UI wherever threads are visible.

In many cases it's also useful to add labels to threads programatically.
