# Thread created

This event is fired when a new thread is created in your workspace.

You can subscribe to this event **if you want to build an auto-responder**. To do so, when you receive this event, use the `replyToThread` mutation to send a reply back to the customer.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Every email you receive in your workspace is linked to a thread. If we cannot find a matching
  thread for an email, we will create one. When this happens, you may receive two events:
  `thread.thread_created` and [`thread.email_received`](/webhooks/email-received) (depending on your
  webhook target event subscriptions). If you do, and you only care about emails which are not the
  first message of the thread, please check the `isStartOfThread` in the
  [`thread.email_received`](/webhooks/email-received) payload.
