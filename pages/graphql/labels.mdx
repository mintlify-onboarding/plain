# Labels

Labels are a light-weight but powerful way to categorise threads. They can be added manually or programatically.

For example, when a contact form is submitted, adding labels to a thread allows you to then know ahead of time in Plain what people are getting in touch about.

Each thread can have multiple labels. Labels are not free form but instead must be of one label type. Label types are managed in your settings (**âŒ˜ + K** and then search for "Manage labels").

Label types can be archived. When a label type is archived labels are kept on threads. This is so that if you categorise threads with something and then later change your categories that data is not lost.

Label changes can also be a starting point for integrations [via our webhooks](/webhooks/thread-labels-changed). This lets you build workflows triggered by the addition of a label.
