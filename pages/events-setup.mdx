# Events

Events are a powerful API feature of Plain which let you log key events in a customer's usage of your product so that when you are helping them you have the full context of what's happened.

<ImageContainer withBorder={true}>

</ImageContainer>

When you create an event in Plain you specify the content of the event using a simple GraphQL request and our [UI Components](/ui-components).

When that customer then gets in touch you will see the events you created interleved with all messages and other thread activity.

Some examples use-cases of events:

- Keep track of key account activity such as upgrading of plans, inviting team members or changing sensitive settings in your product.
- Logging errors or potential issues your customer run into (e.g. someone encounters an unexpected error using your product)
- Logging key events in your own system such as the changing of feature flags or releases.
