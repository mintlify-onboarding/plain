# Introduction to Plain

Plain is the customer support tool for technical teams and products.

We want to bring engineering and customer service teams together by creating a modern opinionated platform that's fantastic to build with.

### Where should I start?

First, you should sign-up to Plain by visiting https://app.plain.com/ and following the instructions there.

As part of this process, you'll need to [set up email](/email-setup).

After that, you can:

- [Log important events](/custom-timeline-entries) to your customers' timeline so you have the full context when helping.
- [Add Customer Cards](/customer-cards) to get information directly from your backend when helping customers.
- [Organize your customers into groups](/customers-setup/customer-groups) so you can better prioritise.
- [Explore our API](/graphql-api) to build automations custom to you.

### Feedback

If you have any feedback on our docs we'd love to hear it! Open an issue straight in [Github](https://github.com/team-plain/docs) or drop us an email
