## How it works

1. A customer is viewed in Plain.
2. Plain fires a request to your backend with:

   - The customer's email and, if set, `externalId`
   - The configured Customer Card `key`s

3. Your backend responds with the JSON for each card
4. Cards are shown to the user in Plain.

Based on your Customer Card settings, Plain will send a request to your API like the below example:

```json
{
  "cardKeys": ["plan-details"],
  "customer": {
    "email": "alex@grocery.co",
    "externalId": "your_user_id_795BFCD5-130F-4E72-BD46-14F717BE0830"
  }
}
```

Your API should then reply with a list of cards matching the requested keys where each card contains the components you want to display:

```json
{
  "cards": [
    {
      "key": "plan-details",
      "timeToLiveSeconds": 86400,
      "components": [
        {
          "componentText": {
            "text": "Enterprise Tier"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## UI Components

To define what each customer card should look like, you use the Plain UI components. All the components are documented in the [Plain UI Components](/ui-components/) section.

You can find example Customer Cards and an example API you can check out [team-plain/example-customer-cards](https://github.com/team-plain/example-customer-cards). Feel free to try these out in your workspace!

## Caching of cards

Caching of Customer Cards is controlled via two properties:

1. A time to live value (in seconds) in the Customer Card's settings. This can be changed under **Settings** → **Customer Cards**. Any changes will only apply to newly loaded Customer Cards.
2. An explicit time to live value (in seconds) in your API response with the key `timeToLiveSeconds`. This overrides the value from settings and allows your API to dynamically set the TTL using custom logic.

Any card that is past its expiry time will usually be deleted within a few minutes but no later than 48 hours after expiry.

## Example cards

To demonstrate what you can build with Customer Cards we've built some examples you can view and which are open source.

## Playground

The Customer Cards Playground lets you build and preview the component JSON needed to create a Customer Card. Use this to prototype a Customer Card before starting to build your integration.
