For example - this is a button that links to Stripe.

```json
{
  "componentLinkButton": {
    "linkButtonUrl": "http://stripe.com/",
    "linkButtonLabel": "View in Stripe"
  }
}
```

and it looks like this:

<Frame>
  ![Example button linking to stripe](/public/images/ui-components/link-button-stripe.png)
</Frame>

In the GraphQL API schema, we have two separate unions for Custom Timeline Entry Components and Customer Card
Components, but both unions share the same types therefore they can be treated as the same.

To see UI components in action you can experiment with them:

- in the [Custom Cards playground](https://app.plain.com/developer/customer-cards-playground/)
- in the [Custom Timeline Entry playground](https://app.plain.com/developer/custom-timeline-entry-playground/)
