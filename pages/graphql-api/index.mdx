# GraphQL API

Plain's GraphQL API can be used to manage any aspect of Plain. It's the API that we use to build the Plain app which means **there are no restrictions in what you can do via the API**.

## Key details

Our API is compatible with all common GraphQL clients with the following details:

- **API URL:** `https://core-api.uk.plain.com/graphql/v1`
- **Allowed method**: POST
- **Required headers:**
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` where token is your API key. See [authentication](/graphql-api/authentication/) for more details.
- **JSON body:**
  - `query`: the GraphQL query string
  - `variables`: a JSON object of variables used in the GraphQL query
  - `operationName`: the name of your GraphQL operation (this is just for tracking and has no impact on the API call or result)

If you'd like to use the **GraphQL schema to generate types** for your client code you can fetch the schema
from: `https://core-api.uk.plain.com/graphql/v1/schema.graphql`

## Your first API call

In this example we're going to get a customer in your workspace by their email address. You can find a customer's email on the right hand side when looking at them in Plain.

You will need an API key with the `customer:read` permission. See [authentication](/graphql-api/authentication/) for details on how to get an API key

    You'll need to set two shell variables:

    - `PLAIN_TOKEN`: The API key
    - `PLAIN_CUSTOMER_EMAIL`: The email of the customer you want to fetch

    ```shell
    PLAIN_TOKEN=XXX
    PLAIN_CUSTOMER_EMAIL=XXX
    curl -X POST https://core-api.uk.plain.com/graphql/v1 \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $PLAIN_TOKEN" \
      -d '{"query":"query customerByEmail($email: String!) { customerByEmail(email: $email) { id fullName updatedAt { iso8601 } } }","variables":{"email":"'"$PLAIN_CUSTOMER_EMAIL"'"},"operationName":"customerByEmail"}'
    ```

    This assumes you've installed our Typescript SDK.

    <Steps>
      ### Install the SDK

      ```shell
      npm install @team-plain/typescript-sdk
      ```

      ### Set up the code
      Make sure to replace the api key and email in the code

      ```ts filename="script.js" {3-4}
        const { PlainClient } = require('@team-plain/typescript-sdk');

        const apiKey = 'XXX';
        const email = 'XXX'

        const client = new PlainClient({
          apiKey: apiKey
        });

        client.getCustomerByEmail({ email: email }).then(result => {
          if (result.error) {
            console.error(result.error);
          } else {
            console.log(result.data);
          }
        });
      ```

      ### Run it

      ```shell
      node script.js
      ```
